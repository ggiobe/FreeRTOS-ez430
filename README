This is a port of the FreeRTOSV6.1.1 Demo to the ez430-RF2500 Wireless
development tool using Code Composer Studio v4.2. Running the demo on the ez430 
requires no additional hardware, so you should be able to just compile and debug.

The eZ430-RF2500 uses the MSP430F2274 which contains 1KB of RAM and 32KB of flash
memory. The number of concurrent tasks is very limited due to th small RAM size,
but this demo is still very useful for learning how to use FreeRTOS.

I have completed porting the LED flashing tasks (vStartLEDFlashTasks) and the 
serial communication tasks (vAltStartComTestTasks) and both are fully operational.
However, in my testing, it is not possible to enable the LED flashing and serial
communication tasks at the same time. I have not investigate the cause yet, 
but it is probably related to memory constraints. At any rate, there are only 
two LEDs on the board, so it is better to run the tasks separately if you want
meaningful visual feedback.

To enable/disable tasks, just comment out/in the relevant lines of code in main()

Currently working demo tasks:
vStartLEDFlashTasks - flashes the two LEDs at different rates
vAltStartComTestTasks - UART of serial pins in loopback mode, repeatedly sends
                        the letters A-X at uneven intervals. 


More information coming soon.
